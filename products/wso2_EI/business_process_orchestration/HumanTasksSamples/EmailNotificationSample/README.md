Sample request to invoke service

   <p:notify xmlns:p="http://www.example.com/claims/">
      <!--Exactly 1 occurrence-->
      <firstname>Dilshani</firstname>
      <!--Exactly 1 occurrence-->

#### ClaimService
- This service will create humn notification. When we start notification via "HumanTask Explorer", it may consider deadline condition

According to this sample, param called "amount" should be less than "10000". It is defined in "ClaimsApprovalTask.ht" as follows;
```
<htd:condition>
<![CDATA[htd:getInput("ClaimApprovalRequest")/test10:amount < 10000]]>	
</htd:condition>
```
If you don't need any condition, it can define as follows;
```
 <htd:condition>
		 <![CDATA[true()]]>	
 </htd:condition> 
```
If that condition going to meet, it will going to escalate after given time as follows: It is one minute in the sample.
```
<htd:for>PT1M</htd:for>
```
After the escalation, mail should be receive.
#### Note:
